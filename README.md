## Python Version

For this exercise you can use any python version from **3.10** to **3.12**

## Setup Virtual Environment

We recommend to install **pip**, a package manager for Python that helps you install and manage Python libraries and packages.

Create a Virtual Environment for this exercise with 

`python3 -m venv .venv`

and activate it with

`A1\Scripts\activate` (Windows)

Once inside the venv install all the required libraries with 

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


**Alternatively**, if you use **VSCode** you can let the IDE handle this by typing ">Python: Create Environment" into the search field.
The IDE will guide you through the process above. Select "Venv" as your environment type and then your desired python version. 
Check the option to install the detected `requirements.txt` file.
